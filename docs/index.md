# `pplib` - The Point Process Library

This site contains the *scientific* and `code` documentation for [pplib](https://github.com/andreabonvini/pplib), a `python` library for *Point Process Analysis*.

The *scientific documentation* consists of a series of quick blog-posts explaining the theoretical details behind the algorithmic implementation.

The *code documentation* consists of a series of code snippets showing the usage of the library.
